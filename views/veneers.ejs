         <ul>
             <li>Teeth that are discolored -- either because of root canal treatment; stains from tetracycline or other drugs, excessive fluoride or other causes; or the presence of large resin fillings that have discolored the tooth</li>
             <li>Teeth that are worn down</li>
             <li>Teeth that are chipped or broken</li>
             <li>Teeth that are misaligned, uneven, or irregularly shaped (for example, have craters or bulges in them)</li>
