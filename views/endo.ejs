            <p>Root canal treatment is designed to eliminate bacteria from the infected root canal, prevent reinfection of the tooth and save the natural tooth. When one
                undergoes a root canal, the inflamed or infected pulp is removed and the
                inside of the tooth is carefully cleaned and disinfected, then filled and sealed.</p>
